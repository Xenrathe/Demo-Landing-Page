# Demo-Landing-Page

First major project, to create (from-scratch) a professional, if generic, landing page for a business.

Mostly this is a demonstration of the ability to use Flexbox and other tools to position objects relative to each other (i.e. create a layout).

I've opted to customize it for a fake business related to my game-development project.
